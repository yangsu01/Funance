              Funance was created because I'm unemployed and have nothing better
              to do. The original intent was to create a simple portfolio
              simulator to play with some friends. But then I realized people
              aren't nearly as interested as I thought they would be in
              investing... So I decided to write a <i>weekly</i> blog.

            <p className="fs-5">
              I have always been interested in finance and investing but always
              procrastinated when it came to actually working on a project
              relating to it. So this was the perfect opportunity to learn more
              about quantitative finance and record <i>my journey</i>.

              Originally, Funance was a simple Flask app. It was a bit tedious
              but pretty easy to implement. I then realized there would be
              scalability issues. So I decided to use a more modern setup. How
              much work could it be? I gave myself a weekend to learn React and
              a few more days to re-implement everything. Mistakes were made. I
              ended up rewriting both the frontend and backend from scratch. But
              hey, at least the UI is a lot better now... right?

              I am a (somewhat) recent grad from university. After working for a
              few months as a full-stack developer, I realized I had no idea
              what I wanted from my career. I studied engineering for 6 years
              but ended up doing something completely different right out of
              school. So now I'm taking a break to figure things out.

                <strong>Photography:</strong> I like taking pics. Currently, I
                mainly use my trusty Ricoh GRIII for everyday photos but I also
                have a Canon M50 (its supposed to be for video but I use it for
                photos...) with a few lenses that I use on trips or other
                special occasions. Check out some of my photos at{" "}

                decided to get Catan (the classic entry board game). And the
                next thing I know, I have a collection of over 30 games (REAL
                games, not frauds like Monopoly). Currently, my favorite game is{" "}

                <strong>Travel:</strong> Ever since I went to Denmark for an
                exchange semester, I've been hooked on traveling. During my time
                in Europe, I visited 11 countries (mostly solo, top 3 cities?...
                [Lisbon, Athens, Budapest] ). In the last year, I also went to
                New York, Montreal, and Portland. Travel pics can be found at{" "}
